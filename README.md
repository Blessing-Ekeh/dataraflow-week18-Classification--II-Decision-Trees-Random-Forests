## Week 18: Advanced Classification Models
### Project Overview
This repository contains the tasks, assignments, and assessments for Week 18 of the Dataraflow programme. The primary focus of this week is the implementation and optimization of Decision Tree and Random Forest classification models. The projects cover various real-world applications, including customer purchase prediction, fraud detection, and healthcare risk assessment.
### Datasets and Tasks
1. Weekly Tasks: Customer Purchase Prediction
These tasks involve building basic classification models to predict whether a customer will make a purchase based on demographic data.

- Task 1 (Decision Tree): Predicts "Purchased" (0 or 1) using customer Age and Salary.

- Task 2 (Random Forest): Utilises the same feature set (Age, Salary) to improve prediction accuracy through ensemble learning.

2. Assignments: Model Optimization and Comparison
These assignments focus on fine-tuning hyperparameters and comparing model performances across different industries.

- Assignment 1 (Decision Tree Optimization): Focuses on Customer Churn prediction. Features include Annual Income, Spending Score, and Online Purchase Frequency to determine if a customer "Will Churn".

- Assignment 2 (Random Forest Optimization): A Fraud Detection project. It uses transaction details such as Amount, Time of Day, Account Age, and Previous Transactions to identify "Is Fraud".

- Assignment 3 (Classifier Comparison): A healthcare-focused task predicting Diabetes Risk. It compares models using physiological metrics like BMI, Blood Pressure, Glucose Level, and Insulin Level.

3. Weekly Assessment: Employee Attrition Prediction
The final assessment involves a comprehensive analysis of employee data to predict attrition ("Left Company").

- Target: Left_Company (Boolean).
- Key Features: Job Role, Monthly Income, Work-Life Balance, Job Satisfaction, Years at Company, and Overtime status.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)
